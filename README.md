# Me learning Node.js by building a Domino Machine 👇

## Stack: Node.js 

### STEPS TO PLAY ✨:
1. Deposit some money
2. Determine the number of lines to bet on
3. Collect the bet amount
4. Spin the slot amount
5. Check if the user won
6. Give the user the winnings
7. Play again （￣︶￣）↗　

### Concepts learned 🧠:
- While loop and For loop
- Functions
- Data types (Constant, Float)
- If-Else statements
- Array manipulation
- Prompt-sync
- Transposing a matrix/2d array/reels 

### What's next?
- Javascript ES6
- Node's Async Nature (Promises and Callbacks)
- Event-Driven Programming in Node
- Learning react and express framework
- Middleware
- Version control tool and package management
- Database management
- Security

### Conclusion (●'◡'●):
In conclusion, learning Node.js was a good experience overall. However, there were some parts of the code related to spinning the slot machine, transposing the matrix, displaying styled rows, and calculating winnings that were not fully understood. I need to build more projects with node.js.
